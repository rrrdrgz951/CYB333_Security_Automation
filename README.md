# Password Strength Analyzer

A Python-based tool that evaluates the strength of user-provided passwords and offers actionable suggestions for improvement. This project demonstrates core security automation skills and integrates best practices for code quality and documentation.

## Overview

The Password Strength Analyzer checks passwords for common weaknesses, such as insufficient length, lack of character variety, and missing special symbols. It provides a clear strength rating (Weak, Moderate, Strong) and specific suggestions to help users create more secure passwords.

## Features

- Checks for minimum password length (configurable)
- Detects presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
- Rates password strength as Weak, Moderate, or Strong
- Offers tailored suggestions for improvement
- Simple command-line interface
- Well-documented and easy to extend

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
https://github.com/rrrdrgz951/CYB333_Security_Automation.git

## Usage

1. Run the script in your terminal:
main.py
2. When prompted, enter the password you want to analyze.
3. Review the strength rating and suggestions provided.

## How It Works

The script evaluates passwords based on:
- **Length:** Rewards longer passwords
- **Character Variety:** Checks for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
- **Scoring:** Assigns points for each criterion met
- **Feedback:** Provides suggestions for missing elements

The code analyzer will tell you if the code is Strong or Weak
It will give you suggestions on how to improve password.

You can customize the minimum length or add checks for common passwords in the code.
